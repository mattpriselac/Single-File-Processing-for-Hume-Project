\f0\i0\fs21 \cf0 IN his discussion of personal identity Hume draws a distinction to which his readers have not paid much attention. It is a distinction between 'personal identity, as it regards our thought or imagination, and as it regards our passions  or the concern  we take in ourselves'.
\fs12 \up7 1 
\fs21 \up0 I want in this paper, to examine this distinction and the use Hume makes of it. Although in doing so, I will be commenting  some  of the time on questions of Humean exegesis, my main concern  is to try to throw some light on the role that the idea of oneself plays in our thinking about some of the areas of the emotional life that Hume considers.\

I interpret his answer to it as one that denies that the invariable and uninter\'ad rupted existence he refers to is an actual feature of human life, and offers us a psychological account  of how we come to suppose that  it is. It is this which constitutes his account  of 'personal identity, as it regards our thought  or imagination'.  The  upshot  of  his account is that the life-history of a person (or mind) is merely a sequence of 'different perceptions', which has no 'identity in different', but to which such an identity is indeed ascribed by the 'thought or imag\'ad ination' because of various connections and relationships between  its successive\kerning1\expnd4\expndtw23

\cf0 But whatever the precise dimensions of the problem of the Unity of the person, readers of the 
\f1\i\fs20 Treatise 
\f0\i0\fs21 have noticed that Hume pro\'ad ceeds in Book II as though the problem is safely behind him. They have sometimes felt that he is not entitled to proceed like this, and that he makes use of the idea of the self in his account of the gen\'ad esis of some of the passions, and in his description of the mechan\'ad ism of sympathy, in a way that is inconsistent  with  what  he has said about it in Book I. There is little doubt that at least part of the reason for his _introducing the distinction between personal identity as it concerns  the thought or imagination, and personal identity as   it regards our passions,  in the midst of his discussion  in Book I, is to forestall this criticism. He would achieve this end by making read\'ad ers think  that the role the idea of the self is said to play in Book  II  is one it might very well play whether his treatment of it in Book I is-correct, or whether it is not: that the two discussions are logically independent.\

\cf0 Before looking at this possibility, I must  put  aside  another. Hume clearly does not think that the idea of  the self  that plays a key role in the genesis of some of the passions is the one he ascribes to those metaphysicians that he attacks at the outset of  the Section in the first Book. He insists that he at least does not 
\f1\i\fs20 have 
\f0\i0\fs21 such an idea, because it is not traceable to any impression. Although some commentators seem willing enough to accuse him of the most blatant inconsistency at this point, there seems little -need to read him as though he holds that our emotional life depends critically upon an idea that by his own account we do not even have. There may be inconsistency, but it is likely to be at a deeper level  than this.\

\f0\i0\fs21 referring to the alleged idea of a metaphysical pure ego, but to that sequence of per\'ad ceptions for which it was supposed to provide a principle of  unity: to what many philosophers  have called  the empirical self. His use of the idea thus identified makes it clear that he takes it for granted, in Book II, both that the problem of the ascription of Unity to that sequence need not be raised again, and also that we do have at our disposal, and presuppose in our emotional life, some manner of answering the question about Individuation. With regard to  the latter question, there are countless places where his description of the arousal of the emotions requires us to be able to distinguish other persons from ourselves, and from one another; and it is certainly a pity that he never offers a direct and detailed answer to the ques\'ad tion of Individuation in order to help his readers understand how these vital distinctions are available to us. But not offering  an answer is not the same as being in no position to offer one; and does not of itself constitute inconsistency, open or\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-8

\f0\i0\fs21 \cf0 The case is more complex, however, when we look at his use of the idea of the self in Book II in order to compare it with his views on the question he 
\f1\i\fs22 does 
\f0\i0\fs21 try to answer in Book  I-the problem  of  the Unity of the person. Suppose it should emerge (as I think it does on the most cursory investigation) that his account of the emotions requires\kerning1\expnd-5\expndtw-21

\fs22 It 
\fs21 would then follow that Hume would be mak\'ad ing use in Book II of the belief in something that he described in Book I as a fiction, as something read into a sequence of heterogene\'ad ous perceptions that does not contain it. Admittedly he holds that such a fiction is one of which we could not rid ourselves if we tried, but it is a fiction for all that. This is something that he refrains from recalling to us in Book II; for he has a well-known habit of himself adopting\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-8

\cf0 Ineradicable or not, the fictional status of the Unity of the self has an intriguing consequence, which is the reason for the exegetical comments in this essay.  An emotion  that is founded  on a fiction is a mistaken or false emotion. Insofar as the ascription of unity to one\'ad self is an inescapable element in the genesis of any of our emotions, then these emotions would seem to be mistaken or false mental states. To decide how far such a sweeping conclusion  is justified, we would have to decide whether Hume is right in holding that the unity\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-13

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 argued elsewhere that Hume gives no adequate reasons for such a radical doctrine. But he does espouse it; and I think it likely that he intro\'ad duces the distinction between personal identity as it concerns the thought or imagination, and personal identity as it concerns the pas\'ad sions, in order to prevent any difficult consequence it has from obstructing his account of the\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-11

\fs21 and in our moral criticisms of it. I wish also to ask what presuppositions have to be made for such roles to be possible. Although Hume's ex\'ad pository separation of the two aspects of personal identity is not enough\kerning1\expnd-4\expndtw-18

\f2\i\fs19 (T 
\f3\i0\fs15 II. 
\f0\fs20 i. 1. 276-7). He lists them as 'pride, humility, love, hatred, envy, pity, malice, generosity, with their dependents'. He explains their special character another way, by saying that they do not\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-12

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 him\kerning1\expnd-4\expndtw-16
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 behind if we are to avoid misleading ambiguities. I argued above that his distinction between the cause and the object of the indirect passions, is, in spite of appearances, one which he has to treat as a distinc\'ad  tion among the causes of those passions because he thinks all pas\'ad sions are distinct and separate impressions. We may think that the point he makes in this way is really a logical one: that whatever we may feel, it cannot be 
\f1\i\fs20 called 
\f0\i0\fs21 pride unless something pleasing has come into our purview, and is connected with ourselves, and cannot be 
\f1\i\fs20 called 
\f0\i0\fs21 humility unless something displeasing has come into our purview and is connected with ourselves. Leaving this aside for the present, it is noticeable that Hume is revealingly ambivalent about the nature of the alleged causal sequence that produces pride and humility. While his arguments that the cause and the object are each causal conditions of the passion entail that  both  precede  it, when he sets out the sequence most nearly formally, he places the idea of the self, which he has identified as the object, as an idea that comes \kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-1

\fs20 If 
\fs21 they are understood in this way, then pride and humility are passions that make us think about ourselves,\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-11

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 course, one wants to say, they are  both.  It  is true that  I cannot  be  proud of something unless I presuppose it has some relationship to me; and it is also true that it cannot feed my pride unless it turns my atten\'ad 
\f1\i\fs20 tionfrom 
\f0\i0\fs21 itself 
\f1\i\fs20 to 
\f0\i0\fs21 me. But the trouble is that a linear causal account  of the relationship between the self and its qualities and the passions of pride and humility cannot do justice to this.

\cf0 But although Hume is mistaken if he thinks that what occasions pride is always enjoyable, and what occasions shame is always disagreeable, he is nevertheless close to some important truth when he holds that pleasure and pain are in some manner necessary for pride or shame. In part this just means that being proud and being ashamed are themselves agreeable or disagreeable mental states (as when he tells us that 'the sensation of humility is uneasy, as that of pride is agreeable'

\f0\i0\fs21 \cf0 also right in thinking that pleasure and pain, somehow interpreted, play a necessary role in the attitude we take to that which occasions our pride or shame. But this role is not played by enjoyment or dis\'ad like. It is played, rather, by our being

\cf0 What sorts of things can one be pleased or displeased about, and therefore be able to take pride in or feel shame at? 
\fs22 In 
\fs21 non-Humean language what objects do pleasure and displeasure, and therefore, pride and shame, have?, They appear to be ontologically quite heterogeneous: to include physical things, events, abstract objects, facts, qualities, processes, and many more. I can be pleased by my house, my wedding anniversary, the fact that I am a professor, the colour of my eyes, the growth of my bank balance, and innumer\'ad able other things. If one were to try for ontological economy, and seek to reduce the categories to one, the only plausible candidate here would seem to me to be that of facts. The plausibility of this choice derives from the apparent ease with which one can translate statements about the objects of one's pleasure or displeasure into statements of an overtly factual form. 
\f3\fs20 If 
\f0\fs21 I am pleased at my dog's new tricks, then I am pleased (at the fact) that he can perform them. 
\f3\fs20 If 
\f0\fs21 I am ashamed of losing my job, I am ashamed of the fact that I have lost it. But there are awkward cases, whose significance would be considerable in an ontological debate.

\pard\pardeftab720\li126\fi192\ri661\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Such a formula covers a multitude of problems. One, which can  be left unresolved here, is whether one can think one is pleased or displeased by one fact when one is really pleased or displeased by another: can one, that is, misidentify the object of one's pleasure or displeasure? Another difficulty: what if the fact one is pleased or\kerning1\expnd-8\expndtw-36
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 dis\'ad pleased about is not a fact at all, and one is therefore pleased or displeased mistakenly? Here again I ignore ontological complexities, and state that for someone to be pleased or displeased at something, either that at which he is pleased or displeased is a fact, 
\f1\i\fs20 \'b5ctual or supposed, 
\f0\i0\fs21 or there is some fact of which he is aware or thinks he is aware about that which  pleases  or displeases  him  without  which it would not do so. I can ignore the problem of the ontological standing of supposed facts here, as I have ignored the problem of the ontological standing of actual ones. Perhaps actual and supposed facts can be combined into one class, for example, of propositions, so that one should then ponder 
\f1\i\fs20 their 
\f0\i0\fs21 ontological standing, but I shall not explore this. (It is worth noting that there is at least one obvious difficulty in the way of suggesting that the category used  here should be 
\f1\i\fs20 beliefs: 
\f0\i0\fs21 even if it is true that I cannot be pleased that my horse has won unless I believe that it has, it is not true that it is my belief that it has won that is what I am\kerning1\expnd2\expndtw11

\cf0 Even though someone is logically in a position to feel proud or ashamed of something, and does in fact feel pleasure or  distress at it, he still may not happen to feel pride or shame at it. He may just happen to be the sort of person whose emotions are too disinter\'ad ested either by nature or by training. 
\f3 It 
\f0 is not true that pleasure plus connectedness entails pride, or that displeasure plus connectedness entails shame. 
\f3 It 
\f0 is only true that pride entails pleasure plus con\'ad nectedness, and shame entails displeasure plus\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-9
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 connectedness.\

\cf0 Thert: are occasions when the connectedness seems to be the only source of the pleasure or the displeasure. 
\f3 It 
\f0 might be that the fat family's cook takes no pleasure in the fact of fatness 
\f1\i per se, 
\f0\i0 but is pleased by the family's fatness because, and only because, it is due  to their enthusiasm for her cuisine. A  philosopher  might say that it is 
\f1\i really 
\f0\i0 their enthusiasm for her cuisine that pleases her in that case, and not the fatness it causes, but while one can say this, we do not always do so. Their doctor may be displeased by their fatness, not because he is distressed by such things in themselves, but because such things in his patients reflect unhappily on his ability to get them to listen to his instructions on diet. Here it seems that the fact about the family's obesity which accounts for the cook's pleasure and the doctor's displeasure is simply the fact of its connection with them\'ad selves.\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 obesity, but would not be pleased by it if it were not for its connection with her; that the doctor is ashamed of it,  but would  not  be displeased by it but for its connection with him. (I do not think we can say without paradox that the cook is proud but not pleased, or the doc\'ad tor ashamed but not displeased; the pride entails the pleasure, the shame the displeasure.) In these cases, although the cook and the doctor have to be aware of the obesity of the family, this fact would not, alone, even generate pleasure or distress; it is the fact of its con\'ad nection with themselves that produces each-though it might not produce\kerning1\expnd2\expndtw12

\fs21 \cf0 I turn now to the question of the nature of the actual or supposed connection that is necessary for pride or shame. Here there are com\'ad peting temptations.  On  the one hand  there  is a strong  temptation to say that the connection has to be one that established the fact which I am proud or ashamed of is a fact for which I have some responsibility. On the other hand there is a temptation to hold that any sort of connection is capable of generating these emotions. The second view is nearer the truth than the first. It  is possible to hold, as a moral conviction, that one 
\f1\i\fs20 ought 
\f0\i0\fs21 only  to be proud  or ashamed of that for which one is responsible, but one must not represent this conviction, even if it is true, as a logical truth. 
\fs22 It 
\fs21 is indeed some\'ad times true that looser connections that generate pride or shame carry some imputati@n of responsibility, as in the case of the snob who is proud that a member of his club has been knighted, and feels in his pride that some of the merit that led to the honour has somehow accrued to himself. But however common such suppositions may be, it is not clear that they are present by necessity, even though they might\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-6

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 or\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-14
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 shame as false. Indeed, the humble man who is proud of something con\'ad nected with himself may remain convinced that the connection he has with it is not one that allows  him to take any credit for it, and  he may even be proud for that very\kerning1\expnd-5\expndtw-23
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 reason.\
\pard\pardeftab720\li684\fi199\ri105\sb13\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 So far I have written as though the fact that pleases  me when  I am proud, and the fact of which I am proud, are one and the same, the pride being consequent upon the connection with myself which the fact has. The last question, however, raises  the  possibility, which is perhaps more in accord with Hume's analysis, that they are not. Perhaps what I am proud of, in each case, is not the fact which pleases me, but the 
\f1\i\fs20 fact ofmy connection 
\f0\i0\fs21 with it. Perhaps to say that Jones is proud of his children's achievements is not to say that the fact that they have these achievements makes 
\fs20 him 
\fs21 proud, but to\kerning1\expnd1\expndtw7

\f1\i\fs20 makes 
\f0\i0\fs21 him proud. There is perhaps no point in deciding it in most cases. (There may be a point  in some: the man who is proud  of his ancestors' great deeds is probably proud of the fact that the people who did these great deeds are his ancestors, rather than  of the deeds they did.) I shall continue for convenience to follow my previous idiom, in which what I am proud or ashamed of is a fact that generates pride because of its connection with myself, rather than the idiom in which what I am proud or ashamed of is the very fact of this\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-11

\f3\fs20 It 
\f0\fs21 is also true that the closer the connection some fact has with me, the more nearly universal is the agreement  that it is something  that it is morally appropriate, or is reasonable, to be proud or  ashamed of. Hence something that, for  instance,  my  immediate  ancestor  did is something it is more generally agreed I can be proud of, or ashamed of, than is something done by a remote ancestor.

\f0\i0\fs21 A person is best able to make  his contribution  to a  changing  society if he is not emotionally burdened by his past. Here then, we have excellent moral grounds for changing the temporal boundaries  of the self. 
\fs20 If 
\fs21 we drew these boundaries more narrowly we could gen\'ad erate a convention in which a middle-aged man's youthful actions were classified roughly as the actions of his immediate ancestor are now classified: as the deeds of an earlier self.

\cf0 It is tempting to say that this argument is incoherent. For if it is the case that we judge such emotional involvements with past actions as undesirable or inappropriate, and that is the reason for changing the conventions, does it not follow from this that the undesirability of such involvement is discernible on the basis of our 
\f1\i\fs20 present 
\f0\i0\fs21 conventions? And if someone takes the opposite moral view, and thinks that emotional involvement with such past  perform\'ad ances is a good thing, can he not enforce 
\f1\i\fs20 his 
\f0\i0\fs21 moral preferences on the proposed conventions as well as on the present ones, by insist\'ad ing that one ought to feel just as proud or  ashamed  of  the doings  of an ancestor self who inhabited one's present body as one feels of the recent doings of the present self that inhabits it? Does the pro\'ad posal not shift the weight of a moral decision onto a conventional one?\

\f0\i0 \cf0 Perhaps it ought not to be thought important, in judging an emotion, whether what it is a response to  is part of  the history of the man who has it. This is a moral and not a conceptual thesis. Perhaps it is more important that something leads to certain emo\'ad tional responses in a man than that it is connected to him by the chain of identity. This too is a moral and not a conceptual thesis. Neither thesis is assisted by the suggestion that the character of the emotional response, or its absence, determines whether it is part of his past or not. On the contrary, both are hindered, for they can only be discussed if there is common agreement on what the criteria are for deciding which things belong to a man's past and which do\kerning1\expnd9\expndtw49
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 not.\

\fs20 \cf0 I turn now, more briefly, to the much vaster subject of pride and humility as self-glorification and self-deprecation. These are not naturally spoken of as passions at all, and it is not  to  Hume  that one turns in the first instance for an analysis of them.
\fs12 \up6 11 
\fs20 \up0 What fol\'ad lows here will consequently be much more loosely connected with Hume's text than ,what has gone\kerning1\expnd1\expndtw8

\pard\pardeftab720\li1534\fi199\ri115\sl249\slmult1\sb3\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 While particular pride and shame are emotional states of moder\'ad ate duration, and what one is particularly proud or ashamed of is something connected with oneself, pride and humility are normally of longer duration, and are not episodes in their own right at all.  One cannot be suffused with them or overcome by them as one can be with their particular counterparts. One cannot be humble of any\'ad thing, and the idiom 'proud of .. .' is one whose use indicates par\'ad ticular pride, except in the case of the expression 'proud of himself' which may be ambiguous. For to be proud or humble is to estimate oneself very highly or very modestly. 
\fs21 It 
\fs20 is clear that-this estimate has as its object the very subject who makes it, not mere facts con\'ad nected with 
\fs21 him. 
\fs20 These facts serve rather as the grounds on which the high or low estimate could be justified. (In this role, incidentally, their ontological  heterogeneity, or the appearance ofit, vanishes;\kerning1\expnd3\expndtw15

\f0\fs16 \up0 I must admit some temptation to agree with Robert Payne's judgement that 'When Hume writes of pride in 
\f1\i A Treatise of  Human  Nature, 
\f0\i0 he is like a  man scrambling for shellfish among the rocks' (Payne 1960, 142). A Humean concern for detail, how\'ad ever, might have saved Payne from going on to say that Hume's 'dullness' shows us that 'the English 
\f1\i (sic) 
\f0\i0 have failed to  understand  pride through most of their \kerning1\expnd4\expndtw24

\f3\fs20 It 
\f0\fs21 is this very extended understanding of pride as self-centredness that makes it plausible to argue that concupiscence or sensuality are derivatives of it, in the sense that losing oneself in the concerns of the world and the flesh is a means of hiding one's limitations from one's own\kerning1\expnd2\expndtw11

\cf0 Taken strictly, Hume's analysis of the self in Book I would pro\'ad vide the basis for an attack of the last sort. For if it is correct, the unity.ascribed to the person through time is fictitious, and anything done by, or connected with, an earlier stage of a person cannot in consequence, be ascribed to, or said to have the same connection with, a later stage. This would not preclude pride and humility from occurring, but it would make them ineluctably groundless, for they would presuppose that the object of the high or low estimate the subject made incorporated stretches of personal  history  that  it could\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-12

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 humility\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-14
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 would be ruled out if this were true, and since Hume recognizes that our self-estimates all proceed as

\cf0 There is an interesting historical contrast to Hume's procedure, one which would have surprised Hume if he had been aware of it, and which has been noticed since. I refer to the doctrines of the Buddha.
\fs12 \up6 13 
\fs21 \up0 Buddha is said to have argued that the Hindu view of the self as identical with the cosmic soul is false, somewhat as Hume rejects substantial analyses of the self. And just as Hume infers from the absence of a pure ego that the Unity of the individual which pure ego theories are designed to supply is mythical,  so Buddha  is said to have gone beyond the denial of the identity  of the eternal 
\f1\i\fs20 atman 
\f0\i0\fs21 to the denial of the conventional belief in the persisting identity of the individual. Such conventional belief is an example of 
\f1\i\fs20 avidya, 
\f0\i0\fs21 or ignorance, and is a major source of the compulsive craving that is the source of human misery. For only if the self has some degree\kerning1\expnd8\expndtw41

\cf0 Hume's response to a similar metaphysical predicament is quite opposite. He finds the supposed falsity of the belief in the unity of the person a source of bewilderment and anxiety, and the only cure for the malaise that a sceptical concentration upon it produces is the careless acceptance of the fiction with which we disguise its falsity from ourselves, and the immersion in the life of passion and social intercourse which the acceptance of this fiction makes possible. In\'ad stead of nirvana, there is backgammon. So in Book II, the bewilder\'ad ments of Book I are left behind.\

\cf0 Ifwe take the view, as I would, that Hume's perplexity is ground\'ad less, and that he has not demonstrated the falsity of  our  belief in  the unity of a person, this does  not of itself  free us from  the need  to consider philosophical attempts to question our right to draw the boundaries of the history of individual persons in the ways that we actually\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-2

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 recognized, we are open once more to the suggestion that our moral and emo\'ad tional lives would benefit from their being drawn differently. So we can now imagine a parallel to the forms of conceptual revisionism that I imagined earlier when discussing the relationship between par\'ad ticular pride and shame and self-identity. 
\f3\fs20 It 
\f0\fs21 could be said that our self-estimates might change if they were made in a different context, in which a person was thought to have a past in which those actions or characteristics  now  included  within  it  were  not  included,  or in which other such actions or characteristics were included which are not included now. I would say here, as before, that a recom\'ad mendation for conventional change based on this possibility is not incoherent, but is either undesirable or pointless. 
\f3\fs20 It 
\f0\fs21 could be said, second, that the very presence of such self-estimates now ought to be construed as reasons for including those actions and character\'ad istics offered as grounds for them, and their absence construed as a reason for not including them.

\cf0 In conclusion: Hume may have distinguished between personal identity as it concerns the thought or imagination, and personal iden\'ad tity as it concerns our passions, merely in order to prevent the scep\'ad tical perplexities of Book I from obtruding themselves in Book II. But if we are free of those perplexities, we can.see that his distinc\'ad tion was a wise one for more than tactical  reasons.  For  whatever the span of the self is taken to be, our emotional  life,  or  that  part of it which we have scrutinized here, requires for its logical struc\'ad ture that the span of the self is given. And criticism of the emotional life requires  this also. What  I  take to be myself  determines  what   I can be proud or ashamed of, and not the reverse. The personal identity that concerns the passions has to  be one and  the same as the personal identity that concerns the thought  or imagination.  But it is the thought or imagination, and not the passions, that have to determine its\kerning1\expnd5\expndtw28
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 boundaries.\

\up0 . \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 His account in Book I has itself been said to be inconsistent because he ascribes to the self there a tendency to confuse invariance and suc\'ad cession in telling us how we come to generate the fiction of continu\'ad ing identity; such a story seems to ascribe a continuing reality to the mind in  the very process  of showing how the belief in it can come  to exist when there are only successive perceptions to constitute it. This is a special application of a wider charge sometimes levelled against him, that although his associationism appears to reduce all explanation\kerning1\expnd-6\expndtw-30

\cf0 Many have argued (and I have been among them) that Hume can be acquitted of these charges. Mercer, for_ example, has made short work of the last one (Mercer 
\fs20 1972: 27-30). 
\fs21 When Hume introduces the self in Book II he says clearly that he is.referring to 'self, or that succession of related ideas and impressions, of which we have an intimate memory and consciousness' 
\f2\i\fs19 (T 
\f0\i0\fs15 11. 
\fs21 i. 
\fs20 2. 277), 
\fs21 not to the idea of the pure ego constructed by rationalist philosophers. The charge of confusion in the argument of

\f0\fs21 iv. 6 has been rebutted by several writers, beginning with Nelson Pike (Pike 
\fs20 1967, 
\fs21 McIntyre 
\fs20 1979). 
\fs21 In the briefest summary: since the mind is nothing but a series of perceptions, Hume's question in Book I is not a question about how it is that a mind he tacitly assumes to be more than this comes to think it 
\f1\i\fs20 is 
\f0\i0\fs21 more than this, but a question  about  how the series  that the mind actually is, comes to include within it from time to time perceptions 
\f1\i\fs20 of 
\f0\i0\fs21 the series that represent it as having an identity that it (strictly) lacks. The actual relationship of the mind to its perceptions is one of inclusion, and Hume's puzzle is how certain perceptions 
\f1\i\fs20 of 
\f0\i0\fs21 the mind come to be 
\f1\i\fs20 in 
\f0\i0\fs21 the mind. This reading of Hume may well leave him with some unattractive problems, but it does not convict him of contradicting\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw2
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 himself.\

\f0\i0 \cf0 If 
\fs21 something like this is accepted, we can see Hume in Book I as combining scepticism about philosophical defences of a natural belief with the assumption of an obligation to give an account of how our nature generates the belief. The  belief  is one which  he, as a human being, holds himself, and one which he  regards  it as a 'vain'\kerning1\expnd-4\expndtw-17

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 consistently leave it unquestioned throughout, and perhaps must do so. Instead of a neo-Cartesian attempt at justification, Hume offers us here, as he does in the case of our belief in outer objects and in natural neces\'ad sities, an account of the belief's origin that  gives it  what we may call psychological\kerning1\expnd7\expndtw35
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 intelligibility.\

\cf0 But the shock of transition from Book I to Books II and III does not go away when these considerations are recognized. In the latter two books, Hume deals with the whole range of human motives and feelings, and with the basic requirements of social life and moral\'ad ity. To do this,\'b7he has to draw on a far wider range of beliefs than those he considers in Book I. By the time we reach Book III, we  find a Hume who is no longer examining how individuals confined \kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-1

We have moved, as Nicholas Capaldi puts it, from someone who starts from an 'I think' (or Cartesian) perspective to someone who holds a 'We do' (or social constructivist) perspective (Capaldi 1989). Many problems of Hume interpretation come from the fact that Hume has both of these perspectives; the link between them is Hume's science of man, which shows us how instinct saves us from the immobility that\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-6

\fs21 \cf0 I referred earlier to the distinction Hume makes in 
\f2\i\fs19 TI. 
\f0\i0\fs21 iv. 6 between personal identity 'as it regards our thought and imagination' and personal identity 'as it regards our passions or the concern  we take in ourselves'. The context of this remark makes it clear that he is only to concern himself with the former ('The first is our pn;:sent subject'), and that what he says later about the self and the pass.ions will at most contribute incidentally to the understanding of how we come to attribute identity to the mind. He does mention it once more in Section VI, when he tells us that 'our identity with regard to the passions serves to corroborate that with regard to  the imagination, by the making our distant perceptions influence each other, and by giving us a present concern for our past or future pains or pleasures' 
\f2\i\fs19 (T1. 
\f0\i0\fs21 iv. 6. 261): that is, the life of the passions creates relationships among the perceptions that compose our inner life that reinforce our tendency to view them as part of one \kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-4
life.
\f3\fs11 \up6 5 
\f0\fs21 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \up0 But the key word in this sentence is 'corroborate'. The psychological work of establishing the belief in self-identity is primarily the work of the understanding and imagination, and the life of the passions only reinforces\kerning1\expnd2\expndtw11

\cf0 I still think this is true. But a contrary view appears to be sug\'ad gested by some comments of Capaldi, and Robert S. Henderson has explicitly claimed that Hume answers the problem of other selves in his account of the indirect \kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-4
passions.
\f3\fs12 \up6 7 
\f0\fs20 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 \up0 I would like to look at how Hume does in fact make use of the idea of the self there, to see if perhaps there is any case for thinking that his earlier remark about distinguishing the two aspects of the idea of the self should be read in a way different from that I have accorded it here.

\fs20 \cf0 Hume says a great deal about the role played by the idea of the self in the mechanism that generates pride, humility, love and hatred. Self is said to be the 
\f1\i\fs22 object 
\f0\i0\fs20 of the first two of these passions. Hume distinguishes carefully between the object of a passion and its cause. The cause, he says 
\f2\i (T 
\f0\i0\fs17 11. 
\fs20 i. 2. 278) is that which excites the passion, and the object is that to which the passions direct their view, when excited. He introduces this by saying that the self cannot be their cause 'or be sufficient 
\f1\i\fs22 alone 
\f0\i0\fs20 to excite them' (my italics). I think his phrasing here shows it to be a mistake to think that the idea of the self is not itself a condition (or cause) of pride or humility; it merely shows it cannot be the only condition, and that something else (what we may call the exciting cause) is needed also. But if we pursue the cause-object distinction in the text, it seems to suggest\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-12
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 more.\

\f2\i (T

\f3\i0\fs15 II. 
\f0\fs20 i. 6. 292, where Hume explains the difference between pride and joy: 'In order to excite pride, there are always two objects we must contemplate, viz. the 
\f1\i cause, 
\f0\i0 or that object which  produces  pleasure; and  self, which is the real object of the passion. But joy has only one object 
\f1\i (sic)

\f0\i0\fs21 \cf0 Hume has to presuppose that someone who feels pride already knows that the phenomenon that  generates it is something  related to him or her self, as well as that he or she is turned toward a con\'ad templation of the self by the stimulus of that phenomenon. As the statement at 
\f1\i T 
\f3\i0\fs14 II. 
\f0\fs21 i. 6. 292 indicates, he is fully aware of this, even though he does not insert the fact as an item in the sequence (between\kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-2

\f1\i\fs20 called  up  
\f0\i0\fs21 by it, it has in every instance to be an idea  that we have and use already.  It needs to be 
\f1\i\fs20 in our repertoire. 
\f0\i0\fs21 There is no way in which the mech\'ad anism of pride and humility could be the 
\f1\i\fs20 origin 
\f0\i0\fs21 of our conscious\'ad ness of the distinction between ourselves and others; for it requires us already to have that\kerning1\expnd3\expndtw18

He is not, as far as I can tell, saying that the presence of the idea of the self and others in our repertoire, is an ultimate fact in the same way; and given his views about the origin of ideas in Book I, we might expect him to entertain\kerning1\expnd1\expndtw5

\cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 I have not shown some hitherto unnoticed weakness in the argu\'ad ment of Book II. I have merely sought to show that that argument does not have a recently suggested strength. There are indeed many respects in which it does build vital bridges between the epistemo\'ad logical quandaries of Book I and the social theories of  Book  III. But it does not contain any answer to the psychological question of how we come to recognize that our own perceptions are indeed our own only, and that there are a large number of other selves too. It presupposes, from the outset, that we already know (or believe) this, and can make our discriminations\kerning1\expnd-7\expndtw-31

\cf0 In the course of his difficult but important discussion of  the idea of the self in the 
\f1\i Treatise, 
\f0\i0 Capaldi makes the point that the idea of the self is not a simple idea but a complex one, because it represents a succession of related ideas and impressions, and is therefore not one\kerning1\expnd-3\expndtw-14
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 which\kerning1\expnd1\expndtw8
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 Hume\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-7

 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 the\kerning1\expnd-2\expndtw-10
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 idea of the pure ego. He then says there are two questions to consider with regard to the real-but-complex idea of the self, viz. how is the idea acquired? and what are the relationships among the impressions and ideas that compose the self? This is followed by the statement that 'the answer to the first question  is that  the complex  idea  of  the self emerges originally in action as the object of the indirect passions of pride and humility'. In a note he adds, 
\f3\fs20 'It 
\f0\fs21 is through others that we come to learn about ourselves' (Capaldi 1989: 170 and 347 n). I do not deny either of these claims, or their importance. But although the idea of the self may 
\f1\i emerge 
\f0\i0 when Capaldi says it does, and although the ways we think of ourselves and take concern for ourselves are indeed largely formed through our interaction with others and our sympathetic resonance with their emotional lives, it does not seem to me that, even if we confine ourselves strictly to Hume's own account of these matters, we can see, in either of these important facts, an explanation of how we come to discriminate between ourselves and others. Hume has given us no direct account of this, and therefore has not answered Capaldi's first\kerning1\expnd0\expndtw2
 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 question.\

\f0\fs17 \up0 I take it to be self-evident that the passions of pride and humility require not merely the idea of the self itself, but the idea of the self as distinct from others. Hume of course asumes this when he tells us how, in sympathy, our pride is augmented by the attitudes others have towards us.\

\f3\i0\fs14 II.  
\f0\fs21 i. 11, he uses 
\fs20 it  
\fs21 as  a 'secondary' cause of the self-regarding passions of pride and humility. They emerge 
\fs20 in 
\fs21 part through the opinions of others. 
\f1\i I 
\f0\i0 share, through sympathy, in the admiration of 
\f1\i\fs20 me 
\f0\i0\fs21 expressed by others. My pride in my own achievements is, at least secondarily, the doing of others (if 'doing' is the word) as well as my \kerning1\expnd-1\expndtw-5
own.

\f1\i concern 
\f0\i0 for ourselves is fed by our aware\'ad ness of others and their passions. This story is naturally embellished when one attends to the fact that one is loved (that is, in Hume, admired and praised) 
\f1\i for 
\f0\i0 those qualities that Hume calls the causes of the passions others direct toward me as their object: I will ascribe to myself those qualities for which others admire (or despise) me.

\f3\fs20 It

\fs21 have been trying to discern what limits there are to the enterprise of mining Hume's theory of the passions to recon\'ad struct what his theory  of the self is. And it seems clear  to me that  at some level that very theory depends repeatedly and fundament\'ad ally upon the subject's recognizing himself or herself as one subject among others, each of whom has a private mental 
\fs20 life 
\fs21 too; and that although, given that recognition, the theory of the passions tells us many profound things about how each of us comes to form a self\'ad image through interaction with others, it cannot itself be the source of that recognition.
